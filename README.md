# 👢 knockoff-utils
My custom-made EXILED plugin (a framework that allows you to create game extentions, plugins in this case) that can help out server developers by mashing together a few plugins that I've found, taking their pros, and porting them **(programmed by myself)** into this plugin.

If you have any questions, you can join `https://discord.gg/4pxbyja3jA` and ask me there.

## ❓ How to use

Using this plugin is simple. Download the compiled .dll file and place it in your EXILED plugin folder (usually located under AppData on Windows devices).
